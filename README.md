# Voice Recognition Assistant üó£Ô∏è

A basic voice-based assistant that listens for commands (speech) and performs actions like opening web pages.  
This is a practical project I built after completing courses on speech processing / OpenCV / related domains.

## üéØ Motivation & Background

During my learning journey, I completed courses on **speech recognition**, **audio processing**, and **Python libraries**.  
To put that into practice, I built this voice assistant to:

- Listen for voice commands  
- Convert speech to text  
- Parse and interpret commands  
- Trigger actions (e.g. open a website)  
- Serve as a foundation for more complex assistants  

This project helped me connect theory (audio features, speech APIs) to real, interactive code.

## üß∞ Prerequisites & Installation

You‚Äôll need:

- Python 3.6+  
- Speech recognition library (e.g. `speech_recognition`)  
- Text-to-speech or system utilities (if applicable)  
- (Optional) Webbrowser / OS command libraries
